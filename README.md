# Givtu-Test-Mgmt

## Purpose of the Repository
The repository provides the tooling for testing our backend environments. 

### How to Run Tests

- To run test ```pytest <test_file>```
- E.g. ```pytest test_submit_order.py``` will run all tests in the ```test_submit_order.py``` file. 
- Refer to ```https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/``` to understand how ```pytest``` works.

### TODO

- [ ] Move all testing apis into a test controller on php side
- [ ] Use a password to ensure only givtu users can access api
- [ ] Do not make any of these testing features accessible during production
